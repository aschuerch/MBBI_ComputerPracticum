# Bioinformatics workflows

When working with high-throughput sequencing data, the raw reads you get off of the sequencer will need to pass
through a number of  different tools in order to generate your final desired output. The execution of this set of
tools in a specified order is commonly referred to as a *workflow* or a *pipeline*. 

An example of the workflow we will be using for our variant calling analysis is provided below with a brief
description of each step. 

![workflow](../fig/variant_calling_workflow.png)


1. Quality control - Assessing quality using FastQC
2. Quality control - Trimming and/or filtering reads (if necessary)
3. Align reads to reference genome 
4. Perform post-alignment clean-up
5. Variant calling

These workflows in bioinformatics adopt a plug-and-play approach in that the output of one tool can be easily
used as input to another tool without any extensive configuration. Having standards for data formats is what 
makes this feasible. Standards ensure that data is stored in a way that is generally accepted and agreed upon 
within the community. The tools that are used to analyze data at different stages of the workflow are therefore 
built under the assumption that the data will be provided in a specific format.  


# Quality Control

The first step in the variant calling workflow is to take the FASTQ files received from the sequencing facility
and assess the quality of the sequence reads. 

![workflow_qc](../fig/var_calling_workflow_qc.png)
## Details on the FASTQ format

Although it looks complicated (and it is), it's easy to understand the
[fastq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format) format with a little decoding. Some rules about the format
include...

|Line|Description|
|----|-----------|
|1|Always begins with '@' and then information about the read|
|2|The actual DNA sequence|
|3|Always begins with a '+' and sometimes the same info in line 1|
|4|Has a string of characters which represent the quality scores; must have same number of characters as line 2|

We can view the first complete read in one of the files our dataset by using `head` to look at
the first four lines.

~~~
$ head -n4 SRR098026.fastq
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
@SRR098026.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:968 length=35
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
+SRR098026.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:968 length=35
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
~~~
{: .output}

All but one of the nucleotides in this read are unknown (`N`). This is a pretty bad read!

Line 4 shows the quality for each nucleotide in the read. Quality is interpreted as the 
probability of an incorrect base call (e.g. 1 in 10) or, equivalently, the base call 
accuracy (eg 90%). To make it possible to line up each individual nucleotide with its quality
score, the numerical score is converted into a code where each individual character 
represents the numerical quality score for an individual nucleotide. For example, in the line
above, the quality score line is: 

~~~
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
~~~
{: .output}

The `#` character and each of the `!` characters represent the encoded quality for an 
individual nucleotide. The numerical value assigned to each of these characters depends on the 
sequencing platform that generated the reads. The sequencing machine used to generate our data 
uses the standard Sanger quality PHRED score encoding, using by Illumina version 1.8 onwards.
Each character is assigned a quality score between 0 and 40 as shown in the chart below.

~~~
Quality encoding: !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHI
                  |         |         |         |         |
Quality score:    0........10........20........30........40                                
~~~
{: .output}

Each quality score represents the probability that the corresponding nucleotide call is
incorrect. This quality score is logarithmically based, so a quality score of 10 reflects a
base call accuracy of 90%, but a quality score of 20 reflects a base call accuracy of 99%. 
These probability values are the results from the base calling algorithm and dependent on how 
much signal was captured for the base incorporation. 

Looking back at our read: 

~~~
@SRR098026.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:968 length=35
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
+SRR098026.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:968 length=35
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
~~~
{: .output}

we can now see that the quality of each of the `N`s is 0 and the quality of the only
nucleotide call (`C`) is also very poor (`#` = a quality score of 2). This is indeed a very
bad read.

## Assessing Quality using FastQC
In real life, you won't be assessing the quality of your reads by visually inspecting your 
FASTQ files. Rather, you'll be using a software program to assess read quality and 
filter out poor quality reads. We'll first use a program called [FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) to visualize the quality of our reads. 
Later in our workflow, we'll use another program to filter out poor quality reads. 

FastQC has a number of features which can give you a  quick impression of any problems your
data may have, so you can take these issues into consideration before moving forward with your
analyses. Rather than looking at quality scores for each individual read, FastQC looks at
quality collectively across all reads within a sample. The image below shows a FastQC-generated plot that indicates
a very high quality sample:

![good_quality](../fig/good_quality1.8.png)

The x-axis displays the base position in the read, and the y-axis shows quality scores. In this
example, the sample contains reads that are 40 bp long. For each position, there is a 
box-and-whisker plot showing the distribution of quality scores for all reads at that position.
The horizontal red line indicates the median quality score and the yellow box shows the 2nd to
3rd quartile range. This means that 50% of reads have a quality score that falls within the
range of the yellow box at that position. The whiskers show the range to the 1st and 4th 
quartile.

For each position in this sample, the quality values do not drop much lower than 32. This 
is a high quality score. The plot background is also color-coded to identify good (green),
acceptable (yellow), and bad (red) quality scores.

Now let's take a look at a quality plot on the other end of the spectrum. 

![bad_quality](../fig/bad_quality1.8.png)

Here, we see positions within the read in which the boxes span a much wider range. Also, quality scores drop quite low into the "bad" range, particularly on the tail end of the reads. The FastQC tool produces several other diagnostic plots to assess sample quality, in addition to the one plotted above. 

## Running FastQC  

We will be working with a set of sample data that is located in a hidden directory (`.dc_sampledata_lite`). First, we
will move some of these hidden files to the `data` directory your created at [the end of our
last lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/06-organization/).  

~~~
$ mv ~/.dc_sampledata_lite/untrimmed_fastq/ ~/dc_workshop/data/
~~~
{: .bash}

Navigate to your FASTQ dataset: 

~~~
$ cd ~/dc_workshop/data/untrimmed_fastq/
~~~
{: .bash}

To run the FastQC program, we need to tell our computer where the program is located 
(in `~/FastQC`).  FastQC can accept multiple file names as input, so we can use the *.fastq wildcard to run FastQC on all of the FASTQ files in this directory.

~~~
$ ~/FastQC/fastqc *.fastq
~~~
{: .bash}

You will see an automatically updating output message telling you the 
progress of the analysis. It will start like this: 

~~~

~~~
{: .output}

In total, it should take about five minutes for FastQC to run on all
six of our FASTQ files. When the analysis completes, your prompt
will return. So your screen will look something like this:

~~~

~~~
{: .output}

The FastQC program has created several new files within our
`/data/untrimmed_fastq/` directory. 

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~

SRR098026_fastqc.zip   SRR098028_fastqc.zip   SRR098283_fastqc.zip
~~~
{: .output}

For each input FASTQ file, FastQC has created a `.zip` file and a
`.html` file. The `.zip` file extension indicates that this is 
actually a compressed set of multiple output files. We'll be working
with these output files soon. The `.html` file is a stable webpage
displaying the summary report for each of our samples.

We want to keep our data files and our results files separate, so we
will move these
output files into a new directory within our `results/` directory.

~~~
$ mkdir ~/dc_workshop/results/fastqc_untrimmed_reads
$ mv *.zip ~/dc_workshop/results/fastqc_untrimmed_reads/
$ mv *.html ~/dc_workshop/results/fastqc_untrimmed_reads/
~~~
{: .bash}

Now we can navigate into this results directory and do some closer
inspection of our output files.

~~~
$ cd ~/dc_workshop/results/fastqc_untrimmed_reads/
~~~
{: .bash}

## Viewing HTML files

If we were working on our local computers, we'd be able to display each of these 
HTML files as a webpage: 
 
~~~
$ open SRR097977_fastqc.html
~~~
{: .bash}

However, if you try this on our AWS instance, you'll get an error: 

~~~
Couldn't get a file descriptor referring to the console
~~~
{: .output}

This is because the AWS instance we're using doesn't have any web
browsers installed on it, so the remote computer doesn't know how to 
open the file. We want to look at the webpage summary reports, so 
let's transfer them to our local computers (i.e. your laptop).

To transfer a file from a remote server to our own machines, we will
use a variant of the `cp` command called `scp`. The `s` stands for
"secure" - this is a secure version of copying. 

For the `cp` command, the syntax was:

~~~
$ cp my_file new_location
~~~
{: .bash}

The syntax for `scp` is the same, but now `my_file` and
`new_location` are on separate computers, so we need to give an 
absolute path, including the name of our remote computer. First we
will make a new directory on our computer to store the HTML files
we're transfering. Let's put it on our desktop for now. Open a new
tab in your terminal program (you can use the pull down menu at the
top of your screen or the Cmd+t keyboard shortcut) and type: 

~~~
$ mkdir ~/Desktop/fastqc_html
~~~
{: .bash}

Now we can transfer our HTML files to our local computer using `scp`.

~~~
$ scp dcuser@ec2-34-238-162-94.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/dc_workshop/results/fastqc_untrimmed_reads/*.html ~/Desktop/fastqc_html
~~~
{: .bash}

This looks really complicated, so let's break it down. The first part
of the command `dcuser@ec2-34-238-162-94.compute-1.amazonaws.com` is
the address for your remote computer. Make sure you replace everything
after `dcuser@` with your instance number (the one you used to log in). 

The second part starts with a `:` and then gives the absolute path
of the files you want to transfer from your remote computer. Don't
forget the `:`. We used a wildcard (`*.html`) to indicate that we want all of
the HTML files. 

The third part of the command gives the absolute path of the location
you want to put the files. This is on your local computer and is the 
directory we just created `~/Desktop/fastqc_html`. 

You should see a status output like this:

~~~
SRR097977_fastqc.html                                    100%  318KB 317.8KB/s   00:01    
SRR098026_fastqc.html                                    100%  330KB 329.8KB/s   00:00

SRR098281_fastqc.html                                    100%  329KB 329.1KB/s   00:00    
SRR098283_fastqc.html                                    100%  324KB 323.5KB/s   00:00 
~~~
{: .output}

Now we can go to our new directory and open the HTML files. 

~~~
$ cd ~/Desktop/fastqc_html/
$ open *.html
~~~
{: .bash}

Your computer will open each of the HTML files in your default web
browser. Depending on your settings, this might be as six separate
tabs in a single window or six separate browser windows.

{: .challenge}

## Unzipping Compressed Files

Now that we've looked at our HTML reports to get a feel for the data,
let's look more closely at the other output files. Go back to the tab
in your terminal program that is connected to your AWS instance
(the tab lab will start with `dcuser@ip`) and make sure you're in
our results subdirectory.   

~~~
$ cd ~/dc_workshop/results/fastqc_untrimmed_reads/
$ ls
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
SRR097977_fastqc.html  SRR098027_fastqc.html  SRR098281_fastqc.html
SRR097977_fastqc.zip   SRR098027_fastqc.zip   SRR098281_fastqc.zip
SRR098026_fastqc.html  SRR098028_fastqc.html  SRR098283_fastqc.html
SRR098026_fastqc.zip   SRR098028_fastqc.zip   SRR098283_fastqc.zip
~~~
{: .output}

Our `.zip` files are compressed files. They each contain multiple 
different types of output files for a single input FASTQ file. To
view the contents of a `.zip` file, we can use the program `unzip` 
to decompress these files. Let's try doing them all at once using a
wildcard.

~~~
$ unzip *.zip
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
Archive:  SRR097977_fastqc.zip
caution: filename not matched:  SRR098026_fastqc.zip
caution: filename not matched:  SRR098027_fastqc.zip
caution: filename not matched:  SRR098028_fastqc.zip
caution: filename not matched:  SRR098281_fastqc.zip
caution: filename not matched:  SRR098283_fastqc.zip
~~~
{: .output}

This didn't work. We unzipped the first file and then got a warning
message for each of the other `.zip` files. This is because `unzip` 
expects to get only one zip file as input. We could go through and 
unzip each file one at a time, but this is very time consuming and 
error-prone. Someday you may have 500 files to unzip!

A more efficient way is to use a `for` loop to iterate through all of
our `.zip` files. Let's see what that looks like and then we'll 
discuss what we're doing with each line of our loop.

~~~
$ for filename in *.zip
> do
> unzip $filename
> done
~~~
{: .bash}

When the shell sees the keyword `for`,
it knows to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each item in a list.
Each time the loop runs (called an iteration), an item in the list is assigned in sequence to
the **variable**, and the commands inside the loop are executed, before moving on to 
the next item in the list.

Inside the loop,
we call for the variable's value by putting `$` in front of it.
The `$` tells the shell interpreter to treat
the **variable** as a variable name and substitute its value in its place,
rather than treat it as text or an external command. 

In this example, the list is six filenames (one filename for each of our `.zip` files).
Each time the loop iterates, it will assign a file name to the variable `filename`
and run the `unzip` command.
The first time through the loop,
`$filename` is `SRR097977_fastqc.zip`. 
The interpreter runs the command `unzip` on `SRR097977_fastqc.zip`.
For the second iteration, `$filename` becomes 
`SRR098026_fastqc.zip`. This time, the shell runs `unzip` on `SRR098026_fastqc.zip`.
It then repeats this process for the four other `.zip` files in our directory.

{: .callout}

We have called the variable in this loop `filename`
in order to make its purpose clearer to human readers.
The shell itself doesn't care what the variable is called;
if we wrote this loop as:

~~~
$ for x in *.zip
> do
> unzip $x
> done
~~~
{: .bash}

or:

~~~
$ for temperature in *.zip
> do
> unzip $temperature
> done
~~~
{: .bash}

it would work exactly the same way.
*Don't do this.*
Programs are only useful if people can understand them,
so meaningless names (like `x`) or misleading names (like `temperature`)
increase the odds that the program won't do what its readers think it does.

> ## Multipart commands
> The `for` loop is interpreted as a multipart command.  If you press the up arrow on your keyboard to recall the command, it will be shown like so:

> ~~~   
> $ for zip in *.zip; do echo File $zip; unzip $zip; done
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
> 
> When you check your history later, it will help your remember what you did!
>
{: .callout}

When we run our `for` loop, you will see output that starts like this:

The `unzip` program is decompressing the `.zip` files and creating
a new directory (with subdirectories) for each of our samples, to 
store all of the different output that is produced by FastQC. There
are a lot of files here. The one we're going to focus on is the 
`summary.txt` file. 

## Understanding FastQC Output

If you list the files in our directory now you will see:

The `.html` files and the uncompressed `.zip` files are still present,
but now we also have a new directory for each of our samples. We can 
see for sure that it's a directory if we use the `-F` flag for `ls`. 

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~
{: .bash}

The summary file gives us a list of tests that FastQC ran, and tells
us whether this sample passed, failed, or is borderline (`WARN`).

## Documenting Our Work

We can make a record of the results we obtained for all our samples
by concatenating all of our `summary.txt` files into a single file 
using the `cat` command. We'll call this `full_report.txt` and move
it to `~/dc_workshop/docs`.

~~~
$ cat */summary.txt > ~/dc_workshop/docs/fastqc_summaries.txt
~~~
{: .bash}
