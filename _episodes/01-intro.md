The lessons aim to introduce basic skills in the Unix shell and Microbial Genomics and are designed for learners with no programming experience. The general topics and skills covered include:

### Interacting with Computers
- Could Computing
- Connecting to remote computing (SSH/PuTTY)

### Data Management and Organization
- Unix Shell (command-line: ls, cd, mkdir, cp, rm, wc, grep, cut, columns, head, tail, less etc,)

### Microbial Genomics
- Assembly of high-throughput sequence data
- Annotation of genomes
- Prediction of secreted proteins

## Overview of our Data Set

The sequence of microbial genomes can be used to predict proteins that are secreted by bacteria. *Escherichia coli* strain K-12 holds a key position as a model organism in studies of molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics and biotechnology. The sequence we will be using was cited by several [publications](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=ERX008638+or+ERR022075), especially in the context of genome assembly. Here, we will trim, assemble and annotate the genome of *E. coli* K-12 and will predict secreted proteins from it as well as from an assembled genome of *S. aureus*.
