The lessons aim to introduce and reinforce basic skills in the Unix shell and Microbial Genomics and are designed for learners with no programming experience. The general topics and skills covered include:

### Interacting with Computers
- Could Computing
- Connecting to remote computing (SSH/PuTTY)
- File Transfer (FileZilla, other command-line tools: scp, rsynch, wget, etc. )

### Data Management and Organization
- Unix Shell (command-line: ls, cd, mkdir, cp, rm, wc, grep, cut, columns, head, tail, less etc,)

### Microbial Genomics
- Assembly of high-throughput sequence data
- Annotation of genomes
- Prediction of secreted proteins

## Overview of our Data Set and Narrative

*Escherichia coli* strain K-12 holds a key position as a model organism in studies of molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics and biotechnology. The sequence we will be using was cited by several [publications](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=ERX008638+or+ERR022075), especially in the context of genome assembly. Here, we will trim, assembly and annotate the genome of *E. coli* K-12 in order to determine proteins that are secreted.
