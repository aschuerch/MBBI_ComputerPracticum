questions:
- "How can the information in the sequencing reads be reduced?"
- "What is the effect of k-mer size on assembly?"
objectives:
- "Assemble the short reads"
keypoints:
- "Assembly is a process which aligns and merges fragments from a longer DNA sequence in order to reconstruct the original sequence."
- "k-mers are short fragments of DNA of length k"

Sequence assembly means the alignment and merging of reads in order to reconstruct the original sequence. The assembly of a genome from short sequencing reads will take a while - from minutes up to several hours per genome. 

## Sequence assembly

The assembler we will run is [SPAdes](http://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/). SPAdes generates a final assembly from multiple kmers. A list of kmers is automatically selected by SPAdes using the maximum read length of the input data, and each individual kmer contributes to the final assembly. If desired, a list of kmers can be specified with the -k flag which will override automatic kmer selection.


## Preparation
First of all, let's make an an *E.coli* folder in the assembly folder of the project

~~~
$ cd ~/112018_Secretome/assembly
$ mkdir E_coli
~~~
{: .bash}



To run SPAdes we will use the spades.py command with the --only-assembler option as the reads have already been trimmed, -o for the output folder, -1 for the path to the forward reads, -2 for the path to the reverse reads. To speed up the process, we will be using only two k-mer sizes of 33 and 55 basepair.

~~~
$ cd ~/112018_Secretome/trimmed/E_coli
$ spades.py -1 ERR022075_1.trimmed.fastq -2 ERR022075_2.trimmed.fastq -k 33,55 -o ~/112018_Secretome/E_coli/assembly/ERR022075
~~~
{: .bash}

The assemblies for every k-mer setting are found in the folders marked K33 and K55 and are called final_contigs.fasta. The end result before scaffolding is called contigs.fasta and the scaffolded contigs are available in the file called scaffolds.fasta.

> ## Challenge: How many contigs were generated by SPAdes?

> Find out how many contigs or scaffolds there are in the *E. coli* isolate.
