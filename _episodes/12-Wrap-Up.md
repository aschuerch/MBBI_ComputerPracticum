> ## Exercise
> 
> Compare your lists to the pre-computed lists at [PSORTdb](http://db.psort.org/) for *E.coli* K-12 and *S.aureus* N315. Do you find proteins in common? Do you find differences? Why? Discuss with your neighbor.

We predicted if proteins are secreted based on the presence of signal peptides. Prediction can be different, depending on the method used for prediction, but also based on annotation differences, differences in ORF calling etc. In order to confirm the cellular location of these proteins, laboratory experiments are necessary.
