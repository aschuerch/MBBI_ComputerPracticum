## Searching files

We discussed in a previous episode how to search within a file using `less`. We can also
search within files without even opening them, using `grep`. `grep` is a command-line
utility for searching plain-text files for lines matching a specific set of 
characters (sometimes called a string) or a particular pattern 
(which can be specified using something called regular expressions). We're not going to work with 
regular expressions in this lesson, and are instead going to specify the strings 
we are searching for.
Let's give it a try!

Suppose we want to see how many reads in our file have really bad segments containing 10 consecutive unknown nucleoties (Ns). Let's search for the string NNNNNNNNNN in the SRR098026 file.

~~~
$ grep NNNNNNNNNN SRR098026.fastq
~~~
{: .bash}

This command returns a lot of output to the terminal. Each line in the SRR098026 
file which contains at least 10 consecutive Ns is printed to the terminal. We may be 
interested not only in the actual sequence which contains this string, but 
in the name (or identifier) of that sequence. We discussed in a previous lesson 
that the identifier line immediately precedes the nucleotide sequence for each read
in a FASTQ file. We may also want to inspect the quality scores associated with
each of these reads. To get all of this information, we will return the line 
immediately before each match and the two lines immediately after each match.

We can use the `-B` argument for grep to return a specific number of lines before
each match and the `-A` argument to return a specific number of lines after each matching line. 
Here we want the line before and the two lines after each 
matching line so we add `-B1 -A2` to our grep command.

~~~
$ grep -B1 -A2 NNNNNNNNNN SRR098026.fastq
~~~
{: .bash}

One of the sets of lines returned by this command is: 

~~~
@SRR098026.177 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:1:2025 length=35
CNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
+SRR098026.177 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:1:2025 length=35
#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Redirecting output

`grep` allowed us to identify sequences in our FASTQ files that match a particular pattern. 
But all of these sequences were printed to our terminal screen. In order to work with these 
sequences and perform other opperations on them, we will need to capture that output in some
way. 

We can do this with something called "redirection". The idea is that
we're redirecting what was output to the terminal to another location. 
In our case, we want to print this information to a file, so that we can look at it later and 
do other analyses with this data.

The command for redirecting output to a file is `>`.

Let's try out this command and copy all the records (including all four lines of each record) 
in our FASTQ files that contain 
'NNNNNNNNNN' to another file called 'bad_reads.txt'.

~~~
$ grep -B1 -A2 NNNNNNNNNN SRR098026.fastq > bad_reads.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

> ## File extensions
> 
> You might be confused about why we're naming our output file with a `.txt` extension. After all,
> it will be holding FASTQ formatted data that we're extracting from our FASTQ files. Won't it 
> also be a FASTQ file? The answer is, yes - it will be a FASTQ file and it would make sense to 
> name it with a `.fastq` extension. However, using a `.fastq` extension will lead us to problems

The prompt should sit there a little bit, and then it should look like nothing
happened. But type `ls`. You should see a new file called bad_reads.txt. 

We can check the number of lines in our new file using a command called `wc`. 
`wc` stands for `word count`. This command counts the number of words, lines, and characters
in a file. 

~~~
$ wc bad_reads.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
  537  1073 23217 bad_reads.txt
~~~
{: .output}

This will tell us the number of lines, words and characters in the file. If we
want only the number of lines, we can use the `-l` flag for `lines`.

~~~
$ wc -l bad_reads.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
537 bad_reads.txt
~~~
{: .output}

Because we asked `grep` for all four lines of each FASTQ record, we need to divide the output by
four to get the number of sequences that match our search pattern.

> ## Exercise

>> 249

> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

We might want to search multiple FASTQ files for sequences that match our search pattern.
However, we need to be careful, because each time we use the `>` command to redirect output
to a file, the new output will replace the output that was already present in the file. 
This is called "overwriting" and, just like you don't want to overwrite your video recording
of your kid's first birthday party, you also want to avoid overwriting your data files.

~~~
$ grep -B1 -A2 NNNNNNNNNN SRR098026.fastq > bad_reads.txt
$ wc -l bad_reads.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
537 bad_reads.txt
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ grep -B1 -A2 NNNNNNNNNN SRR097977.fastq > bad_reads.txt
$ wc -l bad_reads.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
0 bad_reads.txt
~~~
{: .output}

Here, the output of our second  call to `wc` shows that we no longer have any lines in our bad_reads.txt file. This is 
because the second file we searched (`SRR097977.fastq`) does not contain any lines that match our
search sequence. So our file was overwritten and is now empty.

We can avoid overwriting our files by using the command `>>`. `>>` is known as the "append redirect" and will 
append new output to the end of a file, rather than overwriting it.

~~~
$ grep -B1 -A2 NNNNNNNNNN SRR098026.fastq > bad_reads.txt
$ wc -l bad_reads.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
537 bad_reads.txt
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ grep -B1 -A2 NNNNNNNNNN SRR097977.fastq >> bad_reads.txt
$ wc -l bad_reads.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
537 bad_reads.txt
~~~
{: .output}

The output of our second call to `wc` shows that we have not overwritten our original data. 

We can also do this with a single line of code by using a wildcard. 

~~~
$ grep -B1 -A2 NNNNNNNNNN *.fastq > bad_reads.txt
$ wc -l bad_reads.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
537 bad_reads.txt
~~~
{: .output}

We've now created separate files to store the results of our search for reads matching 
particular criteria. Since we might have multiple different criteria we want to search for, 
creating a new output file each time has the potential to clutter up our workspace. We also
so far haven't been interested in the actual contents of those files, only in the number of 
reads that we've found. We created the files to store the reads and then counted the lines in 
the file to see how many reads matched our criteria. There's a way to do this, however, that
doesn't require us to create these intermediate files - the pipe command (`|`).

This is probably not a key on
your keyboard you use very much, so let's all take a minute to find that key. 
What `|` does is take the output that is
scrolling by on the terminal and uses that output as input to another command. 
When our output was scrolling by, we might have wished we could slow it down and
look at it, like we can with `less`. Well it turns out that we can! We can redirect our output
from our `grep` call through the `less` command.

~~~
$ grep -B1 -A2 NNNNNNNNNN SRR098026.fastq | less
~~~
{: .bash}

We can now see the output from our `grep` call within the `less` interface. We can use the up and down arrows 
to scroll through the output and use `q` to exit `less`.

Redirecting output is often not intuitive, and can take some time to get used to. Once you're 
comfortable with redirection, however, you'll be able to combine any number of commands to
do all sorts of exciting things with your data!

None of the command line programs we've been learning
do anything all that impressive on their own, but when you start chaining
them together, you can do some really powerful things very
efficiently. Let's take a few minutes to practice.
