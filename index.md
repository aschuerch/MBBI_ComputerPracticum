> *Escherichia coli* strain K-12 holds a key position as a model organism in studies of molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics and biotechnology. We will be using reads available from the [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ERX008638). In addition, we will be using a pre-assembled genome from [*Staphylococcus aureus* subsp. aureus USA300_FPR3757](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_007793.1?report=fasta).
